This analog clock code utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional and visually appealing representation of a traditional analog clock. The HTML structure defines the basic layout, with separate elements for the clock face and hands. CSS is employed to style the clock, including positioning elements and defining their appearance (e.g., colors, sizes).

The JavaScript code is responsible for dynamically updating the clock's hands based on the current time obtained from the system. It calculates the rotation angles for the hour, minute, and second hands, ensuring smooth movement by leveraging the setInterval function to update the clock regularly.
